                        <strong>Wren Stark Haven</strong> is a filmmaker living and working in Queens, New York. 
                        Her films are usually whimsical, hopefully funny, and unanimously 
                        ridiculous. She holds an MFA from NYU Tisch's Grad Film program and 
                        teaches there as an adjunct professor of the arts. She is the co-owner 
                        and founder of Wild Shape Sound, a boutique post-sound studio with 
                        recent credits including <em>The Scout</em> (2025), <em>Revelations of Divine Love</em> 
                        (2025), and <em>Heirs</em> (2025).
